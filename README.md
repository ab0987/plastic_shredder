Precious Plastics Shredder

My friend and I repurposed scrap steel and laser cut the parts for a [Precious Plastics](https://preciousplastic.com/) v2.0 shredder.  We resized most of the parts to be US compatible.

Info on the shredder and the cad files can be found [here](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/shredder) and [here](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/download).
